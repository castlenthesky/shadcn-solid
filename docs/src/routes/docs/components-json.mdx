title: components.json
description: Configuration for your project.
---

The `components.json` file holds configuration for your project.

We use it to understand how your project is set up and how to generate components customized for your project.

Note: The `components.json` file is optional and **only required if you're using the CLI** to
add components to your project. If you're using the copy and paste method, you don't need this
file.

You can create a `components.json` file in your project by running the following command:

```bash
npx shadcn-solid@latest init
```

See the [CLI section](/docs/cli) for more information.

## $schema

You can see the JSON Schema for `components.json` [here](https://shadcn-solid.vercel.app/schema.json).

```json title="components.json"
{
  "$schema": "https:/shadcn-solid.vercel.app/schema.json"
}
```

## tailwind

Configuration to help the CLI understand how Tailwind CSS is set up in your project.

See the (installation section)[/docs/installation] for how to set up Tailwind CSS.

### tailwind.config

Path to where your `tailwind.config.js` file is located.

```json title="components.json"
{
  "tailwind": {
    "config": "tailwind.config.js" | "tailwind.config.ts"
  }
}
```

### tailwind.css.path

Path to the CSS file that imports Tailwind CSS into your project.

```json title="components.json"
{
  "tailwind": {
    "css": {
      "path": "src/app.css"
    }
  }
}
```

### tailwind.color

This is used to generate the default color palette for your components. **This cannot be changed after initialization.**

```json title="components.json"
{
  "tailwind": {
    "color": "gray" | "neutral" | "slate" | "stone" | "zinc"
  }
}
```

### tailwind.css.variable

You can choose between using CSS variables or Tailwind CSS utility classes for theming.

To use utility classes for theming set `tailwind.cssVariables` to `false`. For CSS variables, set `tailwind.cssVariables` to `true`.

```json title="components.json"
{
  "tailwind": {
    "css": {
      "variabe": `true` | `false`
    }
  }
}
```

For more information, see the (theming docs)[/docs/theming].

**This cannot be changed after initialization.** To switch between CSS variables and utility classes, you'll have to delete and re-install your components.

### tailwind.prefix

## alias

The CLI uses these values and the `paths` config from your `tsconfig.json` or `jsconfig.json` file to place generated components in the correct location.

Path aliases have to be set up in your `tsconfig.json` or `jsconfig.json` file.

**Important:** If you're using the `src` directory, make sure it is included under `paths` in
your `tsconfig.json` or `jsconfig.json` file.


### alias.cn

Import alias for your utility functions.

```json title="components.json"
{
  "aliases": {
    "cn": "@/lib/utils"
  }
}
```

### alias.component

Import alias for your components.

```json title="components.json"
{
  "alias": {
    "component": "@/components"
  }
}
```

### alias.ui

Import alias for `ui` components.

The CLI will use the `aliases.ui` value to determine where to place your `ui` components. Use this config if you want to customize the installation directory for your `ui` components.

```json title="components.json"
{
  "alias": {
    "ui": "@/ui"
  }
