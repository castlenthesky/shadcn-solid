An unofficial, community-led [Solid](https://www.solidjs.com/) port of [shadcn-solid](https://ui.shadcn.com).

**This is not a component library. It is how you build your component library.**

You know how most traditional component libraries work: you install a package from NPM, import the components, and use them in your app.

This approach works well until you need to customize a component to fit your design system or require one that isn’t included in the library. **Often, you end up wrapping library components, writing workarounds to override styles, or mixing components from different libraries with incompatible APIs.**

This is what shadcn-solid aims to solve. It is built around the following principles:

- **Open Code:** The top layer of your component code is open for modification.
- **Composition:** Every component uses a common, composable interface, making them predictable.
- **Distribution:** A flat-file schema and command-line tool make it easy to distribute components.
- **Beautiful Defaults:** Carefully chosen default styles, so you get great design out-of-the-box.

## Open Code

shadcn-solid hands you the actual component code. You have full control to customize and extend the components to your needs. This means:

- **Full Transparency:** You see exactly how each component is built.
- **Easy Customization:** Modify any part of a component to fit your design and functionality requirements.

_In a typical library, if you need to change a button’s behavior, you have to override styles or wrap the component. With shadcn-solid, you simply edit the button code directly._

        shadcn-solid follows a headless component architecture. This means the
        core of your app can receive fixes by updating your dependencies, for
        instance, kobalte-ui or corvu-ui.

        The topmost layer, i.e., the one closest to your design system, is not
        coupled with the implementation of the library. It stays open for
        modification.

## Composition

Every component in shadcn-solid shares a common, composable interface. **If a component does not exist, we bring it in, make it composable, and adjust its style to match and work with the rest of the design system.**

_A shared, composable interface means it's predictable for both your team and LLMs. You are not learning different APIs for every new component. Even for third-party ones._

## Distribution

shadcn-solid is also a code distribution system. It defines a schema for components and a CLI to distribute them.

- **Schema:** A flat-file structure that defines the components, their dependencies, and properties.
- **CLI:** A command-line tool to distribute and install components across projects with cross-framework support.

_You can use the schema to distribute your components to other projects or have AI generate completely new components based on existing schema._

## Beautiful Defaults

shadcn-solid comes with a large collection of components that have carefully chosen default styles. They are designed to look good on their own and to work well together as a consistent system:

- **Good Out-of-the-Box:** Your UI has a clean and minimal look without extra work.
- **Unified Design:** Components naturally fit with one another. Each component is built to match the others, keeping your UI consistent.
- **Easily Customizable:** If you want to change something, it's simple to override and extend the defaults.
